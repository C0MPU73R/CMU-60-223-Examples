  <h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Use PureData to play a simple melody. </p>
    <p>The melody is represented as a sequence of notes, stored in a table as integers between 0-127 (this range happens to be the standard representation of &quot;pitche&quot; in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI protocol</a>.</p>

    <p>The procedure for exploring this exercise applies to all exercizes in 1.c.iii. Each exercise has an associated PureData patch, in which you will find step by step instructions. Follow the steps; get the patch working; and begin making changes, variations, additions.</p>
    <p>Consider the follwoing important concepts, implications and questionsof this example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A very simplistic representations of a &quot;melody&quot; is a series of notes played in a particular order. What sonic and/or musical considerations are left out if we only consider pitches in a meldoy?</li>
      <li>A <em>metro </em>object is a fundamental timing object in PureData. It can generate a regular beat which can in turn triggor other <em>events</em>; in this patch, the triggored event are changes in the frequency of an oscillator (the <em>osc~ </em>object). The <em>metro</em> object can also be used to triggor events in the real world (motors, servos, lights, etc.) when a mictrocontroller is connected to PureData.</li>
      <li>Building simple counters in PureData is easy and extremely useful. Look in the <em>intro-to-counters</em> abstraction to see more examples</li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the 1.c.iii.1_music-pitch.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
      <li>Follow the institutions in the patch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>For a challenge, try creating a more exciting rhythmic pattern.</p>
