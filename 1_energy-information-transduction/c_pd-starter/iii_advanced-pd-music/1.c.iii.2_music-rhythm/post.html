<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Use Pure Data to play a sequence with frequences (pitches) and durations (rhythm). </p>

    <p>The melody is represented as a sequence of frequencies, stored in a table as floats between 0-127.<br/>
      Each note in the melody has 
    a specific duration, stored in another table as floats between 0-1000 (ms).</p>
    <p>Follow the steps; get the patch working; and begin making changes, variations, additions.</p>
  <p>Consider the following important concepts, implications and questions of this example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We have added duration to each note in addition to its frequency. What other parameters can make the melody more expressive?</li>
      <li>Imagine each note in the melody as a symbol for some physical event in the real world; this <em>melodic sequencer</em> can easily by employed to sequence actuation of motors, lights, servos, etc.</li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>Open the 1.c.iii.2_music-rhythm.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
    <li>Follow the institutions in the patch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>For a challenge, try creating a series of more exciting melodies and a way to switch back and forth among them with the press of a key on the keyboard (check out the <em>key</em> and <em>keyup</em> objects)</p>
