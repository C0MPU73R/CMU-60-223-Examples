    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Create an enchanted object that uses sound, light and movement to create
      a dream-like state for the audience.</p>

    <p>We will perform these machines simultaneously for a coordinated,
      collaborative, dream experience.  The performance will be coordinated over
      the network from a conductor who provides simple musical cues including
      tempo and loudness. The machines must include some kind of physical
      output, e.g. light, sound, or movements.  They may be entirely autonomous,
      responding only to the conductor, or may include some kind of physical
      input to allow a performer to modulate the output in order collaborate
      with the ensemble.</p>
    
    <p>As a challenge, the Pd digital synthesis techniques may be employed to
      also provide a synthesized sound and/or image from a laptop which
      harmonizes with the physical performance of your object and others.</p>

    <p>We will set up the performance during class time in the Media Lab
      adjacent to the Physical Computing Lab; please make sure your device can
      be easily moved.  We will carry over power supplies as needed.</p>

    <p>Creating sound with physical means is older than recorded history.  The 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel%E2%80%93Sachs">Hornbostelâ€“Sachs
	system is a classic taxonomy of instruments</a> which may inspire you.
	Virtually any object can create sound if mechanical energy is supplied
	to it in an appropriate way.
    
    <h4>Template</h4>

    <p>The instrument/ folder contains a template for a Pd patch for controlling
      the assignment.  The template contains the code which handles the network
      communication with the conductor.  It also has a copy of the conductor
      control interface which can be used for offline testing.  You should copy
      this template and replace the sample instrument with your own Arduino
      communication and synthesis patch.</p>

    <p>The conductor/ folder contains the Pd patch for the conductor's control
      station. It includes the network code for listening for instruments
      joining the performance and then sending a steady stream of rhythmic and
      parametric data to each participating instrument.</p>
