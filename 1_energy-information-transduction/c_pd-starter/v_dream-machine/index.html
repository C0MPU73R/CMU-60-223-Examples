    <h2>Assignment: Dream Machine</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Create an enchanted object that uses sound, light and movement to create
      a dream-like state for the audience.</p>

    <p>We will perform these machines simultaneously for a coordinated,
      collaborative, dream experience.  This is a very open-ended assignment:
      results may include pure-software sound synthesis, physical artifacts
      which create sound or light, physical interfaces for allowing performers
      to interact with the system.</p>

    <h4>Template</h4>

    <p>The instrument/ folder contains a template for a Pd patch for
      controlling the assignment.  The template contains the code which handles
      the network communication with the conductor.  It also has a copy of the
      conductors control interface which can be used for offline testing.</p>

    <p>The conductor/ folder contains the Pd patch for the conductor's control
      station. It includes the network code for listening for instruments
      joining the performance and then sending a steady stream of rhythmic and
      parametric data to each participating instrument.</p>
