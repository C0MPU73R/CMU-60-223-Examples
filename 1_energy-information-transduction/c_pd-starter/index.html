    <h2>Pure Data Starter: Overview</h2>
<p>This section is an introduction to physical computing using
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">dataflow
	programming</a>.  This style expresses computation as a graph in which
	data messages flow over connections between objects which act on the
	data.  We will be using the open-source
	real-time <a href="http://puredata.info">Pure Data (Pd)</a> visual
	programming language, which stems from the same work as the
	commercial <a href="http://cycling74.com/">Max/MSP</a> system.</p>

    <p>Dataflow languages lend themselves well to expressing parallelism,
      event-driven actions, interactive and incremental programming, and
      real-time operation.  Pd presents the program as a visual graph which
      follows a visual analogy of graphical modules that intake and process data
      and pass it along to other modules. Pd programs can be edited as they are
      running by making and breaking connections, editing parameters, and adding
      new operators.  Pd includes many GUI objects so that controls can be
      embedded directly in the program.</p>


    <h3>Takeaway Lessons</h3>

    <p>Pure Data offers tremendous flexibility: in one environment you can
      work with physical computing, audio analysis and synthesis, video
      analysis and synthesis, and more. Pure Data is free and open source, and
      it works on personal computers (Windows, OS X, Linux), smart phones
      (iOS, Android), embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi, Udoo,
      BeagleBone).</p>

    <p>Pure Data is good at: rapid prototyping of interactive audio/visual
      systems, controlling multiple parallel processes with complex timing;
      audio analysis and synthesi. </p>

    <p>Pure Data is bad at: recursive programming, general graphical user
      interfaces, integration of documentation, adhering to computer science
      conventions for naming.  The Pd third-party libraries in particular are
      quirky and poorly documented, but many, many features are
      available.</p>

    <p>Pure Data is very extensible: you can extend Pure Data's functionality
      with C/C++, Python or a range of other text-based programming languages.
      Pd has a simple API for compiling binary <em>extensions</em> which can
      be dynamically loaded into a Pd program and operate like native Pd
      objects.</p>

    <p>Pd programs are called <em>patches</em>.  Pd patches can instantiate
      multiple copies of other patches and treat them as a single object; these
      other patches are then called <em>abstractions</em>.  This is the primary
      means for creating re-usable modules and subroutines.  Patches can also
      incorporate internal subgraphs called <em>subpatches</em> which exist in
      only one copy, but allow for organizing a hierarchy of code within a
      single file.</p>

    <p>Pd abstractions implementing GUIs often use a <em>graph-on-parent</em>
      mode which allows a region of the abstraction patch to be visible in the
      parent patch.  This is typically used to provide GUI control objects
      within a panel.</p>

    <h3>Lab Exercises</h3>

    <p>The lab exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of students or
      small groups.  These will familiarize you with processes you have already
      explored with micro-controllers, but now with a personal computer or
      Raspberry Pi. They will also familiarize you with the work flow for using
      Pure Data on a laptop to communicate with a micro-controller, as well as
      Pure Data on an Raspberry Pi</p>

    <h3>Graded Project: Dream Machine</h3>


    <p>The graded project is inspired by
      the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamachine">Dreammachine</a>,
      &#8220;a&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic" title="Stroboscopic">stroboscopic</a>&#160;flicker device that produces visual
      stimuli. Artist&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brion_Gysin" title="Brion Gysin">Brion

      Brain</em>.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The goal is to make an enchanted object that uses sound, light and
      movement to create a dream-like state for the viewer. We will perform
      these machines simultaneously for a coordinated, collaborative, dream
      experience.  This is a very open-ended assignment: results may include
      pure-software sound synthesis, physical artifacts which create sound or
      light, physical interfaces for allowing performers to interact with the
      system.</p>

    <h3>Challenge Yourself</h3>

    <p>Any one who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking
       some of the optional challenge exercises.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create a automaton percussive instrument that performs changing
	rhythmic patterns</li>

      <li>Create a Pure Data based client-server system where a central server
	running PureData sends messages to numerous client computers running
	PureData, which in turn generate sound or actuates kinetic
	elements.</li>
    </ol>
