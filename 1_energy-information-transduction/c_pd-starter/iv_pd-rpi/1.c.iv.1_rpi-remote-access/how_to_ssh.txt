How to use SSH to connect to your Raspberry Pi remotely:

1. Find your Pi's IP address

    Type the following into a Terminal window running on your Pi:

    > hostname -I

    Take note of the returned IP address. Now you can SSH into your Pi from another computer.

2. SSH into your Pi

    Type this command into a Terminal window running on your computer, replacing <IP> with the IP of your Pi:

    > ssh@<IP>

    You will be prompted for your username and password. You are now connected to the Pi remotely and can execute commands.
