    <h2>Unit 1 Energy, Information, Transduction: Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to <em>Introduction to Physical Computing!</em>  The primary
      reference for the course outline, student expectations, and course
      calendar is the syllabus, which may be
      found <a href="http://physcomp.org/syllabus/">on the course web site.</a>
      The course is structured into three major units, beginning with Unit 1:
      Energy, Information, Transduction, spanning five weeks.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this unit is to introduce a fundamental understanding of
      the energy and information transfer processes which connect the physical
      world with computational processes.  Along the way, we will rapidly bring
      every student up to speed with basic electronics and programming through a
      series of lab exercises and several graded projects.</p>

    <p>The unit is divided into three sections: Basic Electronics, Arduino
      Starter, and Pure Data Starter.  The overall objectives include the
      following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>practice effective collaboration</li>
      <li>understand the basics of physical signal processing</li>
      <li>get to know and respect the lab</li>
      <li>get to know what physical computing is and where you see it</li>
      <li>understand how to build basic interface circuits for both input and output</li>
      <li>understand some basic techniques for building signal-processing programs in both Arduino C++ and Pd</li>
      <li>learn to use an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi</li>
      <li>learn many other practical lab skills</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All exercises and projects will be performed in pairs or groups, which we
      will be changing frequently to develop your abilities to take on different
      roles in collaboration.</p>

    <p>This is a fast-paced course and you will be expected to learn many new
   skills independently and teach them to each other.  Please see the syllabus
   for a detailed discussion.</p>
