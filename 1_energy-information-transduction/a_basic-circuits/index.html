    <h2>Basic Circuits: Overview</h2>
<p>This first section is about establishing core electrical concepts and
       standard vocabulary for talking about electronics.  Everybody in the
       class is starting from a different level of experience (perhaps none) but
       needs to develop a common language for working together.</p>

    <p>The following list is an informal summary of basic electrical concepts
       which will be used throughout the course.  Please read through everything
       and keep this for reference.  If the terminology is unfamiliar, it will
       become familiar through practice with the exercises.  If it is review,
       then please help your classmates with understanding the exercises.</p>

    <h3>Takeaway Lessons</h3>

    <p>Electricity is the flow of electrons through a conductor.</p>

    <p>Electricity is invisible; we use instruments such as multimeters and
       oscilloscopes to measure it and render it visible.</p>

    <p>An electrical current conveys energy.</p>

    <p>Electric potential is measured in volts.  Potential can exist between any
       two points in a circuit or conductor; it is a relative measure.  It is a
       measure of potential energy, and exists whether or not a current is
       flowing between those two points.</p>

    <p>Electric current is measured in amperes (amps).  Current is the volume of
       electron flow past a point.</p>

    <p>Electrical currents can vary with time.  The simplest case is the AC
       (alternating current) wall power in which the voltage is formed as a 60
       Hz sine wave (in the US) for transmission efficiency.  In contrast, our
       lab power supplies and batteries will output DC (direct current) which
       has a constant voltage.</p>

    <p>An electrical current can encode information. </p>

    <p>Information can be conveyed even with very small amounts of energy.  In
       practice there are very different kinds of electrical signals and
       circuits for processing information (e.g. from sensors) versus actuating
       mechanical systems (e.g. motors, speakers).</p>

    <p>An electric potential across a <em>resistance</em> causes a current to
      flow through it. Resistance is measured in ohms and is measured along a
      pathway through a conductor.</p>

    <p>Virtually all materials have a finite <em>resistivity</em>, which is a
      property of the material.  The resistance of a path through a material is
      a function of the resistivity and the length and cross-section of the
      conductive path.  Longer and thinner wires have more resistance, shorter
      and thicker wires have less resistance.  Copper has lower resistivity than
      aluminum or steel; silver is better yet.</p>

    <p>A current flowing through a resistance converts electrical energy to
       heat. This is commonly termed <em>dissipation</em>.</p>

    <p>An insulator is a material with very high resistance, i.e., a typical
       voltage will cause negligible current flow through it.</p>

    <p>The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance in an
       electrical path is described by Ohm's Law: <span class="eqn">V = i *
       R</span>, in which V represents a voltage measured across a resistance R
       through which current i is flowing.  Ohm's Law can be trivially rewritten
       as <span class="eqn">i = V / R</span> and <span class="eqn">R = V /
       i</span>.</p>

    <p>Electricity flow is loosely analogous to water flow: current is analogous
       to the volume of flow of water through a pipe, voltage is analogous to
       the pressure difference between two locations, and resistance is
       analogous to friction.  However, it is good practice to think directly in
       terms of electrical properties rather than relying on this
       comparison.</p>

    <p>A resistor is a type of electronic component engineered for a precise and
       constant resistance property.  Resistors are designed with a guaranteed
       minimum capability for dissipating energy.  In general, physically larger
       resistors have more dissipation capacity.  Resistors come in a variety of
       physical shapes and means of electrical connection.  No resistor is
       precisely the specified value; resistors are specified with a tolerance
       range.  Highly precise resistors generally cost more.  In practice,
       resistors have no dynamic behavior.</p>

    <p>Resistors have a constant value for any voltage and current within their
      rating.  Ohm's Law for a resistor means that current and voltage follow a
      simple linear relationship given a constant R.</p>

    <p>Wires can be viewed as resistors with low resistance values.  Ideally the
      resistance is low enough not to affect circuit operation, but in circuits
      delivering energy the wire resistance needs to be considered.</p>

    <p>A <em>short-circuit</em> (or "short") is an unintended low-resistance
       connection between two points, e.g.  bare wires touching accidentally, a
       stray drop of solder bridging two pins, or a DMM probe touching two
       circuit board traces. The effects of a short can range from nothing to
       smoke and destruction, depending on the location and available
       energy.</p>

    <p>In practice, resistors are used to relate current and voltage within a
       circuit rather than to generate heat.  Heat is normally an undesirable
       side-effect.</p>

    <p>There are many other types of passive and active components: capacitors,
       inductors, diodes, transistors, LEDs, lamps, integrated circuits, motors,
       solenoids, and thousands more.</p>

    <p>Unlike resistors, most components do not have a simple constant
      resistance.</p>

    <p>The DMM (digital multi-meter) measures fundamental properties of an
       electrical signal: voltage and current.  It also measures electrical
       properties of materials (either components or conductors): resistance,
       capacitance, and inductance.  The DMM is most useful for measuring
       relatively constant properties, as the numeric display doesn't show rapid
       variation well.</p>

    <p>Measuring voltage with a DMM requires attaching it between two points,
      since voltage is a relative measure.</p>

    <p>Measuring current with a DMM requires routing a signal <em>through</em>
      the meter, since current is a measurement of flow.  This frequently
      requires modifying the circuit by <em>opening</em> a connection and
      replacing it with the path through the meter.  The meter itself has a
      different physical connection point for measuring current that offers a
      low-resistance path: for this reason it is very important not to use the
      current input unless actually measuring current, otherwise you will short
      out a circuit and potentially damage the meter.</p>

    <p>The oscilloscope draws a dynamic graph of the voltage of an electrical
       signal.  It is most useful for visualizing time-varying signals.  The
       oscilloscope can plot a signal over many orders of magnitude of time
       scale; in the course we will generally deal with signals varying at
       scales ranging from microseconds to seconds, but modern electronics
       involves signals at nanosecond scales and shorter.  In contrast, human
       perception operates at scales closer to tenths of a second.</p>

    <p>Sensors are transducers which convert a physical signal to an electrical
       signal.  Some common transducers have variable resistance, e.g., for a
       given voltage across them, the current through them will vary depending
       upon physical state.  Two examples: a switch has a resistance near zero
       or near infinity depending on position, a CdS photocell has a resistance
       varying from about 1000 ohms to millions of ohms depending on light
       intensity.  Sensors can have a time-varying response: the switch changes
       resistance near-instantly, the CdS photocell can take hundreds of
       milliseconds to respond to a sudden change.  There exists a vast variety
       of sensors to couple nearly any physical process of interest into
       electrical information.  Optical sensors are especially useful building
       blocks since many other physical effects can be transduced to a variation
       in light, and then transduced from light to a variation in
       electricity.</p>

    <p>Circuits are arrangements of components and conductors engineered for a
       particular purpose.  You must learn to recognize certain fundamental
       circuit structures which will be used throughout the course.</p>

    <p>A circuit is a graph; circuit topology matters more than exact physical
       layout.  This becomes less true at the extremes: low-voltage,
       high-current, or high-frequency circuits require more attention to
       physical layout.  For this course this will come into play with DC motor
       circuits.</p>

    <p>Electrical engineering has been wildly successful at providing means for
       converting energy and information to and from electrical form and
       providing tools for manipulating electrical energy and information.
       Historically, computation and signal processing has also been performed
       in other domains. The first closed-loop control system was actually a
       mechanical computation performed with a flyball governor.  Elaborate
       mechanical computers were constructed to represent mathematical functions
       before the advent of electronic computing. Analog electronic computers
       were used before digital electronic computers were developed.  None of
       these methods have scaled to the complexity of digital computing, but all
       still have application for particular problems.</p>

    <p>Analog circuits refer to systems in which the energy or information is
      represented by continuously varying electrical signals.  E.g. a
      photoresistor exhibits a continuously varying resistance as a function of
      the incident light, and in a circuit can be wired to produce a
      continuously varying voltage or current.  A microphone produces a voltage
      proportional to air pressure and represents sound as an oscillating
      voltage.</p>

    <p>Digital signals are discretized signals in which specific values of
      voltage or current are defined to represent specific symbols.  In the most
      common case, only two symbols are represented, labeled zero and one.  This
      encodes a single binary digit, or <em>bit</em>, as the current or voltage
      on a wire.</p>

    <p>The specific values of voltage or current representing a digital symbol
      depend on the specific components.  The Arduino follows the 5V CMOS
      convention, so voltages below 1.5V are considered zero or LOW and voltages
      above 3.7V are considered one or HIGH.  Voltages in-between are
      potentially ambiguous but will be arbitrated into a distinct value when
      passing through a digital input.  Please note that other microcontrollers
      such as the Arduino Due operate at 3.3V and circuits in laptops and cell
      phones at even lower voltages, so these thresholds will be different.
      Connecting between different logic families can require level-translation
      circuitry if the values are not compatible.</p>

    <p><em>Schematics</em> are circuit diagrams showing the logical connection
      of electronic components. A schematic does not define the physical layout
      of components or conductors, so constructing a circuit from a schematic
      requires applying additional knowledge.  However, a good schematic
      contains enough information to construct a functional circuit assuming
      common engineering experience. </p>

    <p>Schematic signals are often named to convey intended purpose of a
      connection.  In digital circuits, a bar over a name or a slash in front of
      it indicates an <em>active-low</em> signal in which the low-voltage state
      is the <em>active</em> state.  The meaning of active is relative to the
      specific case: for example, an input labeled /RESET is active-low, so a
      zero-voltage input is &#8220;active&#8221; in the sense that the circuit
      is reset (and hence not operating).</p>

    <h3>Lab Exercises</h3>

    <p>The lab exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of students.
      These will familiarize you with the lab and basic electronic equipment.
      The exercises will be performed in the lab during class time, but also
      outside class as needed.  The lab exercises are not graded but are
      essential for developing the vocabulary and skills to fulfill the graded
      assignments.</p>

    <p>The lab exercises are divided into two parts, <em>Ohm's Law</em> and
      <em>Schematics and Breadboards</em>, each containing a number of
      exercises.  The lab exercises are detailed on the course website
      under <a href="http://physcomp.org/assignments/">assignments</a> and as a
      set of notes and schematics in
      the <a href="https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-examples/tree/master/1_energy-information-transduction/a_basic-circuits">physcomp-examples
      github distribution</a>.  The github files can be checked out to your own
      computer for reference.</p>

    <p>The initial exercises are intended to be quick, simple introductions, but
      please be sure that each member of each student pair practices each
      physical and measurement skill.  Part of the exercise is absorbing a set
      of technical terms; the meaning will become apparent in time through
      immersion in practice.</p>

    <h3>Graded Project: One In - One Out with basic circuits</h3>


    <p>The project assignments are intended to be performed by groups of
    students.</p>Use electricity to create a connection between two physical processes,
      e.g., allow one process to control or affect another.  This is the essence
      of the single-input single-output system.  Solving the task is trivial: a
      battery, switch, and lamp are sufficient.  The hard part is identifying
      and achieving an interesting purpose.

    <p>One In - One Out is many things:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>It is about creating a process: energy and information enters, energy
      and information is emitted.  The circuit becomes part of a larger
      system.</li>

      <li>It is about creating a relationship: otherwise disjoint elements can
	be connected indirectly via electricity to accomplish a human
	purpose.</li>

      <li>It is about controlling time: all circuits involve delay (even if very
      short).</li>

      <li>It is about crossing space: electricity is an energy form which is
	particularly easy to transmit from place to place.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The physical project can be built on a breadboard, with actuators and
    sensors attached to scrap with tape and hot glue.</p>

    <p>The full deliverables for this graded assignment are defined in the
    syllabus section titled Grading Rubric.</p>

    <hr/><!-- --------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <h3>Challenge Yourself</h3>

    <p>Any one who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking
       some of the optional challenge exercises.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Heat-sink a resistor to keep it intact for higher voltages in the
	smoke-a-resistor exercise.</li>

      <li>Create a sensor, i.e. a transducer converting a signal from one form
	of energy to another.  Hint: the input or output could involve
	mechanical, electrical, thermal, or optical energy.  Mechanical energy
	includes pneumatics and sound.</li>

      <li>Create an actuator, i.e., a transducer converting energy from one form
	to another to create a change in the world.  Hint: consider all possible
	forms of energy for both representing the control signal and performing
	the action.  Hint: if you wrap wire around a rod of metal and pass
	current through it you get a magnet.</li>

      <li>Create a system with time-varying behavior.  Hint: the dynamics can
	stem from either the electrical or mechanical domain.  E.g., clocks,
	pendula, hourglasses, discharging capacitors, low-frequency oscillators,
	etc.</li>
    </ol>
