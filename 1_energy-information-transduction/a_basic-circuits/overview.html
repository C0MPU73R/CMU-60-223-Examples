    <h2>Basic Circuits: Overview</h2>

    <p>This first unit is about establishing core electrical concepts and
       standard vocabulary for talking about electronics.  Everybody in the
       class is starting from a different level of experience (perhaps none) but
       needs to develop a common language for working together.</p>

    <p>The following list is an informal summary of basic electrical concepts
       which will be used throughout the course.  Please read through everything
       and keep this for reference.  If the terminology is unfamiliar, it will
       become familiar through practice with the exercises.  If it is review,
       then please help your classmates with understanding the exercises.</p>

    <h3>Takeaway Lessons</h3>

    <p>Electricity is the flow of electrons through a conductor.</p>

    <p>Electricity is invisible; we use instruments such as multimeters and
       oscilloscopes to measure it and render it visible.</p>

    <p>An electrical current conveys energy.</p>

    <p>Electric potential is measured in volts.  Potential can exist between any
       two points in a circuit or conductor; it is a relative measure.  It is a
       measure of potential energy, and exists whether or not a current is
       flowing between those two points.</p>

    <p>Electric current is measured in amperes (Amps).  Current is the volume of
       electron flow past a point.</p>

    <p>Electrical currents can be vary with time.  The simplest case is the AC
       (alternating current) wall power in which the voltage is formed as a 60
       Hz sine wave (in the US) for transmission efficiency.  In contrast, our
       lab power supplies and batteries will output DC (direct current) which
       has a constant voltage.</p>

    <p>An electrical current can encode information. </p>

    <p>Information can be conveyed even with very small amounts of energy.  In
       practice there are very different kinds of electrical signals and
       circuits for processing information (e.g. from sensors) versus actuating
       mechanical systems (e.g. motors, speakers).</p>

    <p>Resistance is measured in ohms.  Resistance is a property of matter and
       is measured along a pathway through a conductor.  </p>

    <p>An electric potential across a resistance causes a current to flow
       through it.</p>

    <p>A current flowing through a resistance converts electrical energy to
       heat. This is commonly termed dissipation.</p>

    <p>Electricity flow is loosely analogous to water flow: current is analogous
       to the volume of flow of water through a pipe, voltage is analogous to
       the pressure difference between two locations, and resistance is
       analogous to friction.  However, it is good practice to think directly in
       terms of electrical properties rather than relying on this
       comparison.</p>

    <p>An insulator is a material with very high resistance, i.e., a typical
       voltage will cause negligible current flow through it.</p>

    <p>The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance in an
       electrical path is described by Ohm's Law: V=i*R. This is
       an empirical relationship which holds true for most common conductors.
       Ohm's Law can be trivially rewritten as i=V/R and R=V/i.</p>

    <p>A resistor is a type of electronic component engineered for a precise and
       constant resistance property with a guaranteed minimum capability for
       dissipating energy.  In general, physically larger resistors have more
       dissipation capacity.  Resistors come in a variety of physical shapes and
       means of electrical connection.  No resistor is precisely the specified
       value; resistors are specified with a tolerance range.  Highly precise
       resistors generally cost more.  In practice, resistors have no dynamic
       behavior.</p>

    <p>In practice, resistors are used to relate current and voltage within a
       circuit rather than to generate heat.  Heat is normally an undesirable
       side-effect.</p>

    <p>There are many other types of passive and active components: capacitors,
       inductors, diodes, transistors, LEDs, lamps, integrated circuits, motors,
       solenoids, and thousands more.</p>

    <p>The DMM (digital multi-meter) measures fundamental properties of an
       electrical signal: voltage and current.  It also measures electrical
       properties of materials (either components or conductors): resistance,
       capacitance, and inductance.  The DMM is most useful for measuring
       relatively constant properties, as the numeric display doesn't show rapid
       variation well.</p>

    <p>The oscilloscope draws a dynamic graph of the voltage of an electrical
       signal.  It is most useful for visualizing time-varying signals.  The
       oscilloscope can plot a signal over many orders of magnitude of time
       scale; in the course we will generally deal with signals varying at
       scales ranging from microseconds to seconds, but modern electronics
       involves signals at nanosecond scales and shorter.  In contrast, human
       perception operates at scales closer to tenths of a second.</p>

    <p>Sensors are transducers which convert a physical signal to an electrical
       signal.  Some common transducers have variable resistance, e.g., for a
       given voltage across them, the current through them will vary depending
       upon physical state.  Two examples: a switch has a resistance near zero
       or near infinity depending on position, a CdS photocell has a resistance
       varying from about 1000 ohms to millions of ohms depending on light
       intensity.  Sensors can have a time-varying response: the switch changes
       resistance near-instantly, the CdS photocell can take hundreds of
       milliseconds to respond to a sudden change.  There exists a vast variety
       of sensors to couple nearly any physical process of interest into
       electrical information.  Optical sensors are especially useful building
       blocks since many other physical effects can be transduced to a variation
       in light, and then transduced from light to a variation in
       electricity.</p>

    <p>Circuits are arrangements of components and conductors engineered for a
       particular purpose.  You must learn to recognize certain fundamental
       circuit structures which will be used throughout the course.</p>

    <p>A circuit is a graph; circuit topology matters more than exact physical
       layout.  This becomes less true at the extremes: low-voltage,
       high-current, or high-frequency circuits require more attention to
       physical layout.  For this course this will come into play with DC motor
       circuits.</p>

    <p>A short-circuit (or "short") is an unintended low-resistance connection
       between two points, e.g.  bare wires touching accidentally, a stray drop
       of solder bridging two pins, or a DMM probe touching two circuit board
       traces. The effects of a short can range from nothing to smoke and
       destruction, depending on the location and available energy.</p>

    <p>Electrical engineering has been wildly successful at providing means for
       converting energy and information to and from electrical form and
       providing tools for manipulating electrical energy and information.
       Historically, computation and signal processing has also been performed
       in other domains. The first closed-loop control system was actually a
       mechanical computation performed with a flyball governor.  Elaborate
       mechanical computers were constructed to represent mathematical functions
       before the advent of electronic computing. Analog electronic computers
       were used before digital electronic computers were developed.  None of
       these methods have scaled to the complexity of digital computing, but all
       still have application for particular problems.</p>

    <h3>Lab Exercises</h3>

    <p>The lab exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of students.
      These will familiarize you with the lab and basic electronic equipment.
      The exercises will be performed in the lab during class time, but also
      outside class as needed.  The lab exercises are not graded but are
      essential for developing the vocabulary and skills to fulfill the graded
      assignments.</p>

    <p>The lab exercises are divided into two parts, <em>Ohm</em> and
      <em>Schematics and Breadboards</em>, each containing a number of
      exercises.  The lab exercises are detailed on the course website
      under <a href="http://physcomp.org/assignments/">assignments</a> and as a
      set of notes and schematics in
      the <a href="https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-examples/tree/master/1_energy-information-transduction/a_basic-circuits">physcomp-examples
      github distribution</a>.  The github files can be checked out to your own
      computer for reference.</p>

    <h3>Graded Project: One In - One Out with basic circuits</h3>


    <p>The project assignments are intended to be performed by groups of
    students.</p

    <p>Use electricity to create a connection between two physical processes,
      e.g., allow one process to control or affect another.  This is the essence
      of the single-input single-output system.  Solving the task is trivial: a
      battery, switch, and lamp are sufficient.  The hard part is identifying
      and achieving an interesting purpose.</p>

    <p>One In - One Out is many things:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>It is about creating a process: energy and information enters, energy
      and information is emitted.  The circuit becomes part of a larger
      system.</li>

      <li>It is about creating a relationship: otherwise disjoint elements can
	be connected indirectly via electricity to accomplish a human
	purpose.</li>

      <li>It is about controlling time: all circuits involve delay (even if very
      short).</li>

      <li>It is about crossing space: electricity is an energy form which is
	particularly easy to transmit from place to place.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The deliverables for this graded assignment are defined in the syllabus
    section titled Grading Rubric.</p>

    <hr /><!-- --------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <h3>Challenge Yourself</h3>

    <p>Any one who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking
       some of the optional challenge exercises.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Heat-sink a resistor to keep it intact for higher voltages in the
	smoke-a-resistor exercise.</li>

      <li>Create a sensor, i.e. a transducer converting a signal from one form
	of energy to another.  Hint: the input or output could involve
	mechanical, electrical, thermal, or optical energy.  Mechanical energy
	includes pneumatics and sound.</li>

      <li>Create an actuator, i.e., a transducer converting energy from one form
	to another to create a change in the world.  Hint: consider all possible
	forms of energy for both representing the control signal and performing
	the action.  Hint: if you wrap wire around a rod of metal and pass
	current through it you get a magnet.</li>

      <li>Create a system with time-varying behavior.  Hint: the dynamics can
	stem from either the electrical or mechanical domain.  E.g., clocks,
	pendula, hourglasses, discharging capacitors, low-frequency oscillators,
	etc.</li>
    </ol>
