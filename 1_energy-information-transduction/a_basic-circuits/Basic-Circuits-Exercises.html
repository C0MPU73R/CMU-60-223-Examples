    <h2>Unit 1A: Basic Circuits Exercises</h2>

    <p>The following exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of
    students.  These will familiarize you with the lab and basic electronic
    equipment.</p>

    <hr /><!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <h3>Exercise: Bench, Battery, Grid</h3>

    <p>Objective: learn basic electrical safety, recognize AC and DC sources,
    learn scale of voltage units.</p>

    <p>Caution: this lesson involves measuring dangerous voltages from the AC
    wall outlets.  Please observe meter settings carefully and avoid touching
    any exposed metal.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Set the DMM to VDC.  Place probes on a 9V battery as shown. Observe
      reading.  It should show approximately 9 Volts.</li>

      <li>Reverse the probes on the battery.  Observe reading. It should be the
      same magnitude with reversed sign.</li>

      <li>Touch leads of 9V lamp to battery contacts.</li>

      <li>Reverse lamp leads.  It should still light: incandescent lamps have no
      polarity.</li>

      <li>A 9V battery has a low enough voltage that it won't cause much current
      flow through dry skin. However, now is a good time to start building the
      habit of not touching wires or leads, and instead using a meter to check
      potentials.</li>

      <li>Set the DC power supply to 9 Volts.</li>

      <li>Repeat DC voltage measurements between read and black terminals.</li>

      <li>Connect the lamp to the power supply terminals.</li>

      <li>Trying varying the power supply voltage up and down by 2 Volts.  Check
      the voltage using the DMM, not just the power supply display.  Observe the
      response of the lamp.</li>

      <li>Caution: the following step calls for measuring the AC wall outlet
      voltage.  Line power has a high enough voltage to be fatal, so think
      through how to make contact safely without any chance of exposed metal
      contacting your body.</li>

      <li>Set the DMM to VAC.  Outlet voltage is alternating current for power
      delivery, this configures the meter to measure the RMS voltage.</li>

      <li>Double-check that the probe connectors are inserted into the probe
      ports for voltage measurement, NOT current measurement.</li>

      <li>Carefully touch the probe tips to the metal blade contacts inside the
      outlet.  Observe the reading, it should be approximately 120.</li>

      <li>Repeat between each blade contact and the round grounding contact.
      Observe readings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Our typical sensor circuits will all use DC supply voltages ranging from
    3.3 to 12V.  Our typical actuator circuits will use DC supply voltages from
    5V to 12V.  Many electronic components have tightly specified supply voltage
    ranges and will malfunction or be destroyed outside that range. </li>

    <hr /><!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <h3>Exercise: Continuity Tests</h3>

    <p>Objective: learn typical scale of resistance units.</p>

    <p>Metals are generally good at conducting electricity; they have low
    resistance.  Common insulators (including air) have a resistance high enough
    it can't be easily measured.  So the most basic resistance measurement is
    the 'continuity check' which simply tests whether the resistance is low
    enough to be considered a conductor, or whether it is unexpectedly high
    representing an open circuit.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Set the DMM to resistance: Ohms, or the large greek omega letter
      &Omega;.  The DMM will emit a small voltage to measure the current which
      results.</li>

      <li>Hold the probe tips in your fingers.  Squeeze harder.  Moisten the
      contact point.  This is safe, you should see a body resistance reading
      which changes with conditions.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes to a coin, keys, and metal tool surfaces.  If you
      fail to see a low reading, try changing contact points, scratching the
      surface, and pressing harder.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes across the leads of a resistor.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes across the leads of an LED.  Reverse the
      connections.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Typical resistance measurements along a short wire will be less than 1
    ohm and are often dominated by the resistance of the contact point and probe
    wires.  Component resistors are available in standard ranges from a fraction
    of an ohm to tens of millions of ohms.  For our typical sensor circuits we
    will be using resistors in the 100 to 10000 (10K) ohm range.</p>

    <hr /><!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <h3>Exercise: Power Switch</h3>

    <p>Objective: test a simple circuit on a breadboard.</p>

    <p>We will use solderless breadboards a lot for prototyping circuits.  The
    connection points accept component leads and solid wire.  Each short row of
    five poing is connected internally and is used for signal connections.  The
    ong rows along the edges are connected internally and are normally used for
    power distribution.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Wire and test the circuit as shown with a switch and a bulb.</li>

      <li>Measure the voltage across the lamp in both on and off states.
	Voltage is measured between two points; the meter is placed
	in <em>parallel</em> with the lamp.</li>

      <li>Current is measured through a conductor; measuring the lamp current
	requires connecting the meter in <em>series</em> with the lamp by
	disconnecting either wire leading to the lamp and connecting the meter
	across the opened connection.</li>

      <li>Set the meter to DC current mode (mA) and move the positive probe to
	the connector for current.</li>

      <li>Open the lamp circuit, connect the meter in-circuit, and observe the
	current in both on and off states.</li>

      <li>The lamp acts as a resistor.  What is the computed resistance in the
	on state?  This can be calculated from the current measured for a given
	applied voltage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>The basic rules of current flow and voltage potentials in a circuit graph
    are captured
    by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws">Kirchhoff's
    circuit laws</a>.</p>

    <h3>Exercise: Voltage Divider</h3>

    <p>Objective: measure current flow in a resistive voltage divider.</p>

    <p>Many sensor circuits we use will be built around an arrangement of series
      resistances called a <em>voltage divider</em>.  This is a fundamental
      construction will will appear again and again.</p>

    <p>Two resistors in series form a single current pathway, so a voltage
      applied across the pair will cause the same current to flow through each
      of them.  However, the voltage drop across each resistor resulting from
      that current is proportional to the resistance (V=i*R), so the voltage at
      the intermediate node depends on the relative resistances.  In the
      simplest case, if both resistances are the same, the voltage in the middle
      will be the average of the voltage at each end.</p>

    <p>We will use the voltage divider structure to allow a variable resistance
      (e.g. sensor or switch) to control the voltage at the intermediate point.
      This is useful for us because the analog-to-digital converter on the
      Arduino senses applied voltage.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure the exact resistance of each resistor.</li>

      <li>Carefully measure the voltage Vin across the pair of resistors.</li>

      <li>Compute the expected voltage V2 across the grounded resistor: V2 =
      Vin*(R2/(R1+R2)), where R1 is the 'upper' resistor connected to the
      positive supply and R2 is the 'lower' resistor connected to ground.</li>

      <li>Vary the input voltage and repeat; you should be able to convince
      yourself that the intermediate voltage scales proportionately.</li>
    </ol>
