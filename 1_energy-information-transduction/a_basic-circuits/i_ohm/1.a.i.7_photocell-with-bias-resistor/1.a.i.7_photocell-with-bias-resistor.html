    <h3>Exercise: Photocell with bias resistor</h3>

    <p>Objective: convert light into a varying voltage.</p>

    <p>A <em>CdS photocell</em>
      (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cds_cell">Cadmium-Sulfide
      photoresistor</a>) is a light sensor in which the resistance
      changes in response to illumination.  They are relatively slow, with a time constant of hundreds of milliseconds, but useful
      for measuring ambient light and shadow.  The resistance decreases in bright light.</p>

    <p>A voltage divider circuit can be used for forming a voltage which depends on the light level.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Measure the resistance of the photocell over different illumination conditions.</li>
      <li>Measure the photocell voltage in the given circuit over different illumination conditions.</li>
      <li>Using the oscilloscope to observe the photocell voltage, try creating
	rapidly changing shadows to estimate the response speed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Rapid light changes and optically encoded data are better measured with phototransistors and photodiodes.</p>
