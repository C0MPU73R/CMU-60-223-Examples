    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Test different types of voltage regulation components.</p>

    <p>Power supplies are the heart of any electronics project, as every circuit
      needs a source of energy, and usually with very specific electrical
      characteristics.  Most of our circuits will require regulated DC supplies,
      with energy coming either from a battery or the building electrical
      system.  Unless otherwise specified, <em>regulated</em> means the voltage
      is controlled to a constant level despite changes in the load.</p>

	  
    <p>We will use two basic categories of voltage regulators: linear and
      switching.</p>

    <p>In brief, a linear regulator acts as a variable resistor governed by
      feedback to keep the output voltage at a fixed level.  Linear regulators
      can only step voltages down, and the excess energy is dissipated as heat.
      So for example, a 5V linear regulator providing a 500&nbsp;mA current from
      a 12V supply creates a 7V voltage drop.  That represents 3.5&nbsp;Watts of
      heat dissipated in the package, which typically means the package needs a
      good heatsink to carry that heat away.
    </p>

    <p>A switching regulator chops the input current at a high frequency and
      either pulses it through an inductor (a coil) to generate higher voltages
      via inductive effects, or filters it through capacitors and/or inductors
      to generate a lower voltage.  The upside of the complexity is much higher
      efficiency, and hence less heat.  The downside is the potential for supply
      noise, since the switching frequency can appear in the output.  But the
      efficiency almost always outweighs the complexity in consumer
      applications, especially for battery circuits.</p>


    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Wire up each circuit, being very careful to observe the correct input
	polarity.</li>

      <li>Measure the unloaded outputs.  Not all switching regulators perform
	well without any load at all.</li>

      <li>Find a power resistor or component representing a reasonable load.
	E.g., dissipating 100&nbsp;mA from a 5V regulator can be accomplished
	using a 0.5&nbsp;Watt 50&nbsp;ohm resistor, or a lamp or motor with
	similar properties.  (Hint: a half-watt 50&nbsp;ohm resistor can be
	formed from two quarter-watt 100&nbsp;ohm resistors in parallel.)</li>
      <li>Measure the loaded output.</li>
      <li>For the switching regulators, using the oscilloscope try to observe
	the switching rate as a high-frequency fluctuation on the output.  This
	signal might be 20-100&nbsp;kHz.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>In the first example of a linear regulator, the the load is only
      consuming 2.5&nbsp;Watts of energy while the regulator dissipates
      3.5&nbsp;Watts, so this circuit is operating at only 42% efficiency.  Linear
      regulator circuits are simple to use and inexpensive, so they are
      applicable for low-power applications or where efficiency and heating are
      not a problem.  The primary advantage is they are potentially low-noise
      compared to switching regulators, so they often appear in high-fidelity
      audio applications.</p>
    
    <p>In contrast, switching regulators typically operate as 85% efficiency or
      higher.  The availability has been remarkably eased by the introduction of
      simple integrated circuits which implement the chopping and feedback
      function.  Consumer 'wall-wart' power supplies used to only use simple
      linear regulation (or no regulation), but nearly all modern power supplies
      for consumer electronics are now switch-mode.</p>

    <p>A good debugging heuristic for any project is to begin solving problems
      by checking the power supply.  There are many, many possible problems, so for example:
      <ol>
	<li>overloading a power supply can cause the voltage to drop or current limits to trip</li>
	<li>power supplies connect across every circuit subsystem, so signal problems can be linked in subtle ways</li>
	<li>high-current signals from motors can create voltages in the ground wires (&ldquo;ground bounce&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>digital supply noise can couple into analog circuits and inject noise</li>
	<li>etc., etc.</li>
      </ol>
