    <h3>Exercise: Voltage Regulation</h3>

    <p>Objective: test different types of voltage regulation components.</p>

    <p>Power supplies are the heart of any electronics project, as every circuit
      needs a source of energy, and usually with very specific electrical
      characteristics.  Most of our circuits will all require regulated DC
      supplies, with energy coming either from a battery or the building
      electrical system.  Unless otherwise specified, <em>regulated</em> means
      the voltage is controlled to a constant level despite changes in the
      load.</p>

    <p>A good debugging heuristic for any project is to begin solving problems
      by checking the power supply.  There are many, many possible problems, so for example:
      <ol>
	<li>overloading a power supply can cause the voltage to drop or current limits to trip</li>
	<li>power supplies connect across every circuit subsystem, so signal problems can be linked in subtle ways</li>
	<li>high-current signals from motors can create voltages in the ground wires (&ldquo;ground bounce&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>digital supply noise can couple into analog circuits and inject noise</li>
	<li>etc., etc.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
	  
    <p>We will deal with two basic categories of voltage Aregulators: linear and
    switching.</p>

    <p>In brief, a linear regulator basically acts as a variable resistor
      governed by feedback to keep the output voltage at a fixed level.  Linear
      regulators can only step voltages down, and the excess energy is
      dissipated as heat.  So for example, a 5V linear regulator providing a
      500&nbsp;mA current from a 12V supply creates a 7V voltage drop.  That
      represents 3.5&nbsp;Watts of heat dissipated in the package, which
      typically means the package needs a good heatsink to carry that heat away.
      Since the load is only consuming 2.5&nbsp;Watts of energy this circuit is
      operating at only 42% efficiency.  Linear regulator circuits are simple to
      use and inexpensive, so they are applicable for low-power applications or
      where efficiency and and heating are not a problem.  The primary advantage
      is they are potentially low-noise compared to switching regulators, so
      they often appear in high-fidelity audio applications.</p>

    <p>A switching regulator chops the input current at a high frequency and
      either pulses it through an inductor (a coil) to generate higher voltages
      via inductive effects, or filters it through capacitors and/or inductors
      to generate a lower voltage.  The upside of the complexity is much higher
      efficiency, and hence less heat.  The downside is the potential for supply
      noise, since the switching frequency can appear in the output.  But the
      efficiency almost always outweighs the complexity in consumer
      applications, especially for battery circuits.</p>
