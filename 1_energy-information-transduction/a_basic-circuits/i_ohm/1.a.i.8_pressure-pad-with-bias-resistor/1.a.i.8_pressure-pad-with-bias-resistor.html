    <p>Objective: convert mechanical pressure into a varying voltage.</p>

    <p>A <em>pressure pad</em>
      (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Sensitive_Resistor">force-sensing resistor</a>, or FSR)
      is a contact sensor in which the resistance
      changes in response to mechanical pressure. The resistance decreases with increased force.</p>

    <p>A voltage divider circuit can be used for forming a voltage which depends on the pressure.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Measure the resistance of the pressure pad over different pressure conditions.</li>
      <li>Measure the pressure pad voltage in the given circuit over different pressure conditions.</li>
      <li>Using the oscilloscope to observe the pressure pad voltage, try creating rapidly changing contact to estimate the response speed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>FSRs can be damaged by excessive force.  In practice, it can take care to
      design them within a mechanical assembly so they are not directly exposed
      to excessive force or forces which pull them apart.  But they are a
      relatively cheap and robust way to make an analog human interface.</p>
