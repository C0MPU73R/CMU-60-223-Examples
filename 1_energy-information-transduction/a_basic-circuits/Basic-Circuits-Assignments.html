    <h2>Unit 1A: Basic Circuits Assignments</h2>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>

    <p>Any one who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking
       some of the optional challenge exercises.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Create a sensor, i.e. a transducer converting a signal from one form
	of energy to another.  Hint: the input or output could involve
	mechanical, electrical, thermal, or optical energy.  Mechanical energy
	includes pneumatics and sound.</li>

      <li>Create an actuator, i.e., a transducer converting energy from one form
	to another to create a change in the world.  Hint: consider all possible
	forms of energy for both representing the control signal and performing
	the action.</li>

      <li>Create a system with time-varying behavior.  Hint: the dynamics can
	stem from either the electrical or mechanical domain.  E.g., clocks,
	pendula, hourglasses, discharging capacitors, low-frequency oscillators,
	etc.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Assignment: One In - One Out with simple circuits</h3>

    <p>Use electricity to create a connection between two physical processes,
      e.g., allow one process to control or affect another.  This is the essence
      of the single-input single-output system.  Solving the task is trivial: a
      battery, switch, and lamp are sufficient.  The hard part is identifying
      and achieving an interesting purpose.</p>

    <p>One In - One Out is many things:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>It is about creating a process: energy and information enters, energy
      and information is emitted.  The circuit becomes part of a larger
      system.</li>

      <li>It is about creating a relationship: otherwise disjoint elements can
	be connected indirectly via electricity to accomplish a human
	purpose.</li>

      <li>It is about controlling time: all circuits involve delay (even if very
      short).</li>

      <li>It is about crossing space: electricity is an energy form which is
	particularly easy to transmit from place to place.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wayfinder: compass-LED flash ring.</li>
      <li>iching buddy: related (what did this mean?)</li>
      <li>Ganzfeld vision quest</li>
    </ol>
