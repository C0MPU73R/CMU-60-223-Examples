    <h2>Arduino Starter: Overview</h2>

    <p>This section is about establishing core concepts of computation as
      related to physical interface.  This connects the behavior of the physical
      world of electrical signals to the logical world of programs, numbers, and
      symbols.</p>

    <p>For the exercises and assignments, we will be using
      the <a href="http://arduino.cc/"><em>Arduino</em></a>, a popular
      microcontroller for physical computing.  The following list is an informal
      summary of basic concepts related to computation with physical signals and
      the Arduino.</p>

    <h3>Takeaway Lessons</h3>

    <p>An Arduino is a small low-power computer with many conventional elements:
      read/write RAM memory, read-only ROM memory, a CPU which executes logical
      and mathematical instructions, and input/output peripheral circuitry.
      This class of computers are called <em>microcontrollers</em> reflecting
      their use as microprocessors controlling hardware.</p>

    <p>Microcontrollers are appropriate for physical computing tasks with low
      computational requirements.  They have low power consumption and
      input/output peripherals specialized for hardware such as
      analog-to-digital converters and PWM waveform generators.  They have
      a single-threaded programming model with no operating system so writing
      hardware-oriented programs can be very simple.</p>

    <p>Physical properties such as position and light intensity are
      intrinsically <em>analog</em> since they have continuity in time and
      space.  In contrast, physical computational processes involve operations
      on numbers representing measurements of the physical properties.  We
      use <em>analog to digital converters</em> (ADCs) to make periodic
      measurements of electrical signals to create digital representations.
      These numerical digital signals are sampled in both time and value, since
      ADCs have a finite precision and speed.</p>

    <h3>Lab Exercises</h3>

    <p>The lab exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of students.
      These will familiarize you with operating the Arduino software, building
      circuits to connect between the analog and digital, and digital
      representation of physical quantities.  The exercises will be performed in
      the lab during class time, but also outside class as needed.  The lab
      exercises are not graded but are essential for developing the vocabulary
      and skills to fulfill the graded assignments.</p>

    <p>The lab exercises are divided into four parts, each containing a number
      of exercises.  The lab exercises are detailed on the course website
      under <a href="http://physcomp.org/assignments/">assignments</a> and as a
      set of notes and schematics in
      the <a href="https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-examples/tree/master/1_energy-information-transduction/b_arduino-starter">physcomp-examples
      github distribution</a>.  The github files can be checked out to your own
      computer for reference.</p>

    <h3>Graded Project: One In - One Out with a microcontroller</h3>

    <p>The project assignments are intended to be performed by groups of
    students.</p>

    <p>Create a one-in-one-out system using circuitry and a microcontroller.
      The general goals remain the same as the basic circuits assignment.  The
      system should take advantage of the complex and versatile behavior enabled
      by software, creating a process in which energy and information are
      transformed <em>computationally</em> to connect one process to
      another.</p>

    <p>One In - One Out with computation can be many things:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Energy and information enters, information is transformed, energy and
	information is emitted, all to accomplish a human purpose.</li>

      <li>The information itself can be inspected symbolically, however, the
	output should be a physical effect rather than symbolic information.</li>

      <li>Computation can apply arbitrarily complex mappings between input and
	output if needed.</li>

      <li>The information may be easily interpretable or not, i.e. a
	quantifiable measurement or a signal resulting from a more complex
	interaction.</li>

      <li>The possibilities for using time are broader; computational processes
	always involve some delay, but now can involve memory and potentially
	long delays.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The physical project can be built on a breadboard, with actuators and
      sensors attached to scrap with tape and hot glue.</p>

    <p>The deliverables for this graded assignment are defined in the syllabus
      section titled Grading Rubric.</p>

    <h3>Challenge Yourself</h3>

    <p>Any one who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking
       some of the optional challenge exercises.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Create a regulatory system, i.e., a <em>controller</em>, which uses
	information measured from the system, i.e. <em>feedback</em>, to maintain
	a state of the system.</li>

      <li>Create a musical system which focuses on physically creating rhythms
	or patterns of sound.</li>

    </ol>
