<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Control a stepper motor using a driver module.</p>

    <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor">stepper motor</a>
      uses a toothed rotor and multiple drive coils to create motion in discrete
      steps.  The fundamental angular size of the steps is determined by the
      physical spacing of the internal magnetic teeth.  Steppers motors
      are <em>open-loop</em> since there is no sensor involved in controlling
      position, the driver simply cycles the coil currents and assumes the motor
      moves synchronously.  If the motor encounters too high a torque, the
      magnetic forces can be overcome and the rotor will slip to a different
      position.  The microcontroller has have no means of detecting this
      error.</p>

    <p>This exercise uses
      an <a href="http://www.allegromicro.com/~/media/Files/Datasheets/A4983-Datasheet.ashx">A4983</a>
      driver module which takes care of cycling the currents appropriately
      through the two coils of a bipolar stepper motor.  The primary inputs to
      the driver are <em>direction</em> and <em>step</em>.  The additional
      inputs control fractional stepping and the overall driver power state.</p>

    <p>As a simple one-in one-out demonstration, the exercise uses a
      potentiometer as an analog position command control input.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Load and run the KnobToStepper sketch from the course materials,
	located in the same folder as this file.  (Note: there is a MotorKnob
	sketch included in the Arduino IDE which assumes the stepper motor is
	directly driven from the Arduino; instead we will use a modular driver
	for this exercise.)</li>

      <li>Observe the stepper motor motion.</li>

      <li>Try moving the MS1 pull-up resistor between 5V and GND and observing
	the resulting change in step rate.  The driver is capable
	of <em>microstepping</em> in which the coils can be driven using PWM
	rather simply on or off in order to divide the fundamental step into
	smaller angles.</li>

      <li>Read the data sheet for the driver and configure the driver for even
	finer steps.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Stepper motors can move relatively fast but at too high a rate can lose count.</p>
