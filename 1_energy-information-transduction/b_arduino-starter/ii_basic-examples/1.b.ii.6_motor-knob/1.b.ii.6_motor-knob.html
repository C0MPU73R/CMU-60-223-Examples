    <h3>Exercise: Motor Knob</h3>
 
    <p>Objective: control a stepper motor using an drive module.</p>

    <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor">stepper motor</a>
      uses a toothed rotor and multiple drive coils to create motion in discrete
      steps.  The fundamental angular size of the steps is determined by the
      physical spacing of the internal magnetic teeth.  Steppers motors
      are <em>open-loop</em> since there is no sensor involved in controlling
      position, the driver simply cycles the coil currents and assumes the motor
      moves synchronously.  If the motor encounters too high a torque, the
      magnetic forces can be overcome and the rotor will slip to a different
      position.  The microcontroller has have no means of detecting this
      error.</p>

    <p>This exercise uses a driver module which takes care of cycling the
      currents appropriately through the two coils of a bipola stepper motor.
      The primary inputs to the driver are <em>direction</em> and <em>step</em>.
      The additional inputs control fractional stepping and the overall driver
      power state.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Load and run the associated sketch from the course materials.</li>

      <li>Observe the stepper motor motion.</li>

      <li>Try moving the MS1 jumper between 5V and GND and observing the
	resulting change in step rate.  The driver is capable
	of <em>microstepping</em> in which the coils can be driven using PWM
	rather simply on or off in order to divide the fundamental step into
	smaller angles.</li>

      <li>Read the data sheet for the driver and configure the driver for even
	smaller steps.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Stepper motors can move relatively fast but at too high a rate can lose count.</p>
