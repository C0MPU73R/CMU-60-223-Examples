# ml-lib

**ml-lib** is a library of machine learning externals for Max and Pure Data.
**ml-lib** is primarily based on the [Gesture Recognition Toolkit](http://www.nickgillian.com/software/grt) by Nick Gillian
**ml-lib** is designed to work on a variety of platforms including OS X, Windows, Linux, on Intel and ARM architectures.

## Installation

- Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/cmuartfab/ml-lib/releases)
- For Max, add the `ml.*.mxo` externals and the ml-lib helpfiles to your Max Search Path
- For Pd, add  `ml.*.pd_*` to your Pd search path and add the "ml" library to your startup flags by opening up the application Preferences and adding "-lib ml" to the Startup Flags

##  Library structure

**ml-lib** objects follow the naming convention `ml.*` where “*” is an abbreviated form of the algorithm implemented by the object. 

Objects fall into one of five categories:

- **Pre-processing**: pre-process data prior to used as input to a classification or regression object
- **Post-processing**: post-process data after being output from a classification or regression object
- **Feature extraction**: extract “features” from control data. [Feature vectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector) can be used as input to classification or regression objects
- **Classification**: take feature vectors as input, and output a value representing the class of the input. For example an object detecting hand position might output 0 for left, 1 for right, 2 for top and 3 for bottom. 
- **Regression**: perform an M x N mapping between an input vector and an output vector with one or more dimensions. For example an object may map `x` and `y` dimensions of hand position to a single dimension representing the distance from origin (0, 0).
