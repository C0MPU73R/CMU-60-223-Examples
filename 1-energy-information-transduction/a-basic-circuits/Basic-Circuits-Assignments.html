    <h2>Unit 1A: Basic Circuits Assignments</h2>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>create a transducer/sensor.</li>
      <li>create an actuator.</li>
      <li>create a system with time-varying behavior.  Hint: the dynamics can be in either the electrical or mechanical domain.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Assignment: One In - One Out with simple circuits</h2>

    <p>Use electricity to create a connection between two physical processes, e.g.,
      allow one process to control or affect another.  This is the essence of the
      single-input single-output system.  Solving the task is trivial: a battery,
      switch, and lamp are sufficient.  The hard part is identifying and achieving an
      interesting purpose.</p>

    <p>One In - One Out is many things:</p>

    <p>It is about creating a process: energy and information enters, energy and information is emitted.  The circuit becomes part of a larger system.</p>

    <p>It is about creating a relationship: otherwise disjoint elements can be connected indirectly via electricity to accomplish a human purpose.</p>

    <p>It is about controlling time: all circuits involve delay (even if very short).</p>

    <p>It is about crossing space: electricity is an energy form which is particularly easy to transmit from place to place.</p>
