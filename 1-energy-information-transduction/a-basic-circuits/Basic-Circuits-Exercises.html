    <h2>Unit 1A: Basic Circuits Exercises</h2>

    <h3>Exercise: Bench, Battery, Grid</h3>

    <p>Objective: learn basic electrical safety, recognize AC and DC sources,
    learn scale of voltage units.</p>

    <p>Caution: this lesson involves measuring dangerous voltages from the AC
    wall outlets.  Please observe meter settings carefully and avoid touching
    any exposed metal.</p>

    <p>Notes on schematic: don't show the bulb plugged in the wall outlet or
    power supply, it will explode.  Or do we have 30V bulbs?</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Set the DMM to VDC.  Place probes on a 9V battery as shown. Observe
      reading.  It should show approximately 9 Volts.</li>

      <li>Reverse the probes on the battery.  Observe reading. It should be the
      same magnitude with reversed sign.</li>

      <li>Touch leads of 9V lamp to battery contacts.</li>

      <li>Reverse lamp leads.  It should still light: incandescent lamps have no
      polarity.</li>

      <li>A 9V battery has a low enough voltage that it won't cause much current
      flow through dry skin. However, now is a good time to start building the
      habit of not touching wires or leads, and instead using a meter to check
      potentials.</li>

      <li>Set the DC power supply to 30Volts.</li>

      <li>Repeat DC voltage measurements between read and black terminals.</li>

      <li>Caution: the following step calls for measuring the AC wall outlet
      voltage.  Line power has a high enough voltage to be fatal, so think
      through how to make contact safely without any chance of exposed metal
      contacting your body.</li>

      <li>Set the DMM to VAC.  Outlet voltage is alternating current for power
      delivery, this configures the meter to measure the RMS voltage.</li>

      <li>Double-check that the probe connectors are inserted into the probe
      ports for voltage measurement, NOT current measurement.</li>

      <li>Carefully touch the probe tips to the metal blade contacts inside the
      outlet.  Observe the reading, it should be approximately 120.</li>

      <li>Repeat between each blade contact and the round grounding contact.
      Observe readings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Our typical sensor circuits will all use DC supply voltages ranging from
    3.3 to 12V.  Our typical actuator circuits will use DC supply voltages from
    5V to 12V.  Many electronic components have tightly specified supply voltage
    ranges and will malfunction or be destroyed outside that range. </li>

    <h3>Exercise: Continuity Tests</h3>

    <p>Objective: learn typical scale of resistance units.</p>

    <p>Metals are generally good at conducting electricity; they have low
    resistance.  Common insulators (including air) have a resistance high enough
    it can't be easily measured.  So the most basic resistance measurement is
    the 'continuity check' which simply tests whether the resistance is low
    enough to be considered a conductor, or whether it is unexpectedly high
    representing an open circuit.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations.</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Set the DMM to resistance: Ohms, or the large greek omega letter
      &Omega;.  The DMM will emit a small voltage to measure the current which
      results.</li>

      <li>Hold the probe tips in your fingers.  Squeeze harder.  Moisten the
      contact point.  This is safe, you should see a body resistance reading
      which changes with conditions.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes to a coin, keys, and metal tool surfaces.  If you
      fail to see a low reading, try changing contact points, scratching the
      surface, and pressing harder.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes across the leads of a resistor.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes across the leads of an LED.  Reverse the
      connections.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>Typical resistance measurements along a short wire will be less than 1
    ohm and are often dominated by the resistance of the contact point and probe
    wires.  Component resistors are available in standard ranges from a fraction
    of an ohm to tens of millions of ohms.  For our typical sensor circuits we
    will be using resistors in the 100 to 10000 (10K) ohm range.</p>
