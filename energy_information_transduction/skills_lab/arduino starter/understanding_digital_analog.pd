#X text 236 142 Analog vs. Digital Signals Analog signals like sound
and voltage are continuous. By contrast \, digital signals are discrete
-- they are comprised of 0s and 1s. Microcontrollers like Arduinos
can take both analog and digital signals as input \, and can output
only digital signals. Arduino has both analog and digital pins. Digital
pins can be either inputs or outputs. Analog pins are always inputs.
The Arduino uses an analog-to-digital converter with 10bit resolution
\, so analog values range from 0 to 1024 (2 ^ 10). At a given point
in time \, a digital signal is always 0 or 1;
