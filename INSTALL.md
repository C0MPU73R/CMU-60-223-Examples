Installation 
============

Installation notes for the physcomp-examples package for the Introduction to
Physical Computing course at Carnegie Mellon University.

The support/Pd-library/physcomp folder contains 'patch' files for PureData which
are used by several examples.  This folder should be added to the pd search
path.

Eventually there may also be a folder to be added to the Arduino compiler search
path.

The numbered folder contains demonstration programs and projects corresponding
