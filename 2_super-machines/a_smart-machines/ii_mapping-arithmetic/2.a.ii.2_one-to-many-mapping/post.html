<h4>Objective: </h4>

    <p>Use several "Arrays" to store several different transfer functions; use these arrays to map an incoming stream of numbers to several different destinations.    </p>
    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Draw four different transfer functions in the four different arrays</li>
      <li>Move the "input" slider and analyze the results in the "output" sliders</li>
      <li>Change the transfer functions and repeat step 2</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments and Challenges</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Use this patch to map one sensor to several different servo rotations so as to create a coordinated cooperative action among all servos</li>
      <li>Use this patch to create a sound composition with four independent tracks</li>
    </ul>
