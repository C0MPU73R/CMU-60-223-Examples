    <p>This section is about encoding <em>behavior</em> in machines, where
      behavior is loosely interpreted as the response of a machine to a varying
      environment in order to achieve an implicit goal.  At the limit, this
      encompasses all of robotics.  However, machines can achieve their smarts
      through many means including physical form which passively interacts with
      the world, mechanical action which responds to forces, and computational
      models which span complexity from simple reflex reactivity to detailed
      world models.</p>

    <h3>Takeaway Lessons</h3>

    <p>Machines have parts which move relative to each other; the elements or
      surfaces where relative motion occurs are <em>bearings</em> and serve the
      functions of controlling relative motion and friction.  These can be
      rolling-contact devices such as <em>ball bearings</em> in which small
      steel balls roll between concentric surfaces, but many common bearings
      are <em>plain bearings</em> in which two surfaces simply slide over each
      other.  Even a book sliding on a table can be considered to be using a
      planar sliding bearing formed by the book jacket and the smooth table: the
      shape constrains motion to the plane, and the smooth materials limit
      friction.</p>

    <p>The common types of bearing components we will use are <em>bushings</em>
      and ball bearings.  Bushings are plain bearings made from a low-friction
      material such as bronze.</p>

    <p>The key principles of shaft bearing design are to consider the <em>radial
	force</em> acting perpendicular to the shaft, the <em>axial force</em>
	(or <em>thrust</em>) acting along the shaft, the <em>bending
	moments</em> induced by the loads, and the <em>torque</em> carried by
	the shaft.</p>

    <p>Most ball bearings have limits on the moments they can support, so a good
      rule of thumb is to <em>always use bearings in pairs</em> such that the
      shaft bending moments are counted by radial forces.</p>

    <p>Common ball bearings can support higher radial loads than axial
      loads.  <em>Thrust bearings</em> are specifically designed to carry axial
      loads, such as in a turntable.</p>

    <p>Electric motors are generally high-speed low-torque devices.  Actuating a
      mechanism almost always requires some form of <em>transmission</em> to
      reduce speed and increase torque to match a load.</p>

    <p>For our purposes, transmissions will be built from rollers, timing
      pulleys and belts, winches and cable drives, and gears.  These are
      mechanisms with constant-ratio <em>transfer functions</em> in which an
      input to output velocities have a fixed ratio.</p>

    <p>In general, any mechanism with a transfer function between input and
      output can act as a type of transmission.  Structures with non-constant
      ratios include levers, cams, and linkages.</p>

    <p>Gear tooth design comes down to a straighforward idea: find compatible
      shapes which interact to produce a constant velocity ratio from input to
      output.  The classic involute gear tooth shape essentially creates the
      simple input-output behavior of two non-slipping rollers, but with the
      increased load capacity of face contact instead of frictional contact.</p>

    <p>In practice, gears have many problems: the teeth must slide across each
      other, creating noise and friction; involute teeth induce forces which
      press the gears apart; high-torque metal gears are often expensive
      precision parts.  However, low-cost gears can be laser-cut and careful
      attention to shaft stiffness can manage tooth pressure forces.</p>

    <p>Other common design problems we will face: attaching gears and pulleys to
      shafts; mounting motors and actuators; attaching feedback sensors; using
      bearings to reduce friction; translating rotational to linear motion;
      building rigid structures; designing for assembly; creating 3D structures
      from flat parts; creating snap-fit and locking features; designing using
      standard parts and fasteners.</p>
