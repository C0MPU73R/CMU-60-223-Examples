    <h2>Super Machines: Overview</h2>
<p>This is the second major unit of
      the <a href="http://physcomp.org/syllabus/"><b>Introduction to Physical
      Computing</b> course</a>.  The purpose of this unit is to address larger
      topics related to making autonomous machines.  This includes pragmatic
      considerations such as basic mechanical design and robust electronic
      fabrication, but also questions related to complex time behavior and
      remembering and modeling simple information about the world.</p>

    <p>The unit is divided into three sections: Smart Machines, State Machines,
      and Get Real.  The overall objectives include the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>learning to use a robust elementary mechanical design idioms</li>
      <li>understand basic machine learning principles</li>
      <li>learn basic state machine theory</li>
      <li>practice developing design ideas incorporating computation effectively</li>
      <li>develop practical skills for making robust self-contained devices</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All exercises and projects will be performed in pairs or groups, which we
      will be changing frequently to develop your abilities to take on different
      roles in collaboration.</p>

    <p>This is a fast-paced course and you will be expected to learn many new
      skills independently and teach them to each other.  Please see the
      syllabus for a detailed discussion.</p>
